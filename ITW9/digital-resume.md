I am now working on final digital resume that will include a html file, a css stylesheet file and this read me file

This is my digital resume with a header that is all about me, Name and Surname, profile image and introductory statement
Below the hearder you will find a navigation bar that directs you to every section of the web page that includes my Education, experience, skills as well as contacts.

On the footer section are contact platforms, you will find icons that will direct you to my social account, like Gmail, Linkedin, Github and Instagram accounts.

Just below the icons you will then find a feedback form where you will fill in as directed, your details with email adresss and a feedback message then click the green submit button after you have filled in everything in order too submit your reviews directly to the owner of the web.

I used YouTube for assistance on my project and theses are some of the pages that assisted me in order to complete this resume:
